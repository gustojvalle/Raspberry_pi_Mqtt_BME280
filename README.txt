	Program was used as base of a system that measures temperature and logs it using a raspberry pi and a BME280 (Bosch temperature sensor)
	
	The system consists of a web based temperature dashboard coded in REACT NATIVE and javascript a single node (so far) of a raspberry pi 
	reading the temperature and sending it through MQTT connection to a broker.
	
	The idea is to expand into more than one node, using ESP32 to read the temperature and map the temperature of the room, that would give enough data
	to control and set the temperature on the central heating system. 
	
	So far I am not messing with the active part of the system, just playing around with the sensor. 
	
	Feel free to improve it if you wish.
